## 🚀 **How to Use the Repository**

### Step-by-Step Procedures for Building Circuits on ISIS and PCBs on ARES

### **Building Circuits in ISIS (Proteus)**

1. **Open Proteus Design Suite**: Launch the **ISIS** application from your Proteus installation.
   
2. **Create a New Project**:
   - Go to **File > New Project**.
   - Name your project and choose a location to save it.

3. **Add Components**:
   - Use the **Component Mode** (P) to access the library.
   - Search for and place the components you need onto the workspace.

4. **Wire the Components**:
   - Select the **Wire Tool** (W) to connect the components.
   - Click on the pins of the components to draw wires between them.

5. **Configure Component Properties**:
   - Double-click on each component to adjust properties (values, settings, etc.).

6. **Run the Simulation**:
   - Click on the **Play** button (▶) to simulate your circuit.
   - Observe the results in the **Virtual Instruments** (like oscilloscopes, multimeters) if used.

7. **Save Your Work**:
   - Save the project by going to **File > Save**.

### **Creating PCBs in ARES (Proteus)**

1. **Open ARES**: Start the **ARES** application from your Proteus installation.

2. **Create a New PCB Project**:
   - Go to **File > New Project**.
   - Choose a name and save location.

3. **Import from ISIS**:
   - Use **File > Import > From ISIS** to bring your circuit schematic into ARES.

4. **Arrange Components**:
   - Place the components on the PCB layout area. Adjust their positions for optimal routing.

5. **Route the PCB**:
   - Select the **Route Tool** to draw tracks between the component pads.
   - Ensure all connections are made, following design rules.

6. **Define Design Rules**:
   - Set your design rules for traces, clearances, and other parameters through **Design > Design Rules**.

7. **Export Gerber Files**:
   - Once the design is complete, export Gerber files via **File > Export > Gerber** for PCB manufacturing.

8. **Save Your PCB Layout**:
   - Save your work by going to **File > Save**.
